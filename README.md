# Blender-Non-Destructive-Workflow
Guide to Non-Destructive Workflow for Hard-Surface Modelling and Sculpting. Some shurtcuts, Modifiers, and how to fix weird issues

## Modifiers
### General Mesh Manipulation
- **Mirror =** Mirrors an object across X, Y, or Z Axis
- **Subdivision Surface =** Create higher resolution by adding points between existing vertices
### Hard-Surface Modelling
- **Edge Split =** Used to define where smooth shading stops (Also see *Mark Sharp*)
- **Screw =** Create a full object from an edge (Imagine a triangle turning into a pizza from a spiral). Turn on Calc Order and Flip
- **Bevel =** Add Bevel to edges. Turn off Clamp Overlap, Profile: 1
### Sculpting
- **Multiresolution =** Like Subdivision, but in steps. Preserves the lower Subdivisions, and can go back and forth between them. Rebuild Subdivisions can be used to Remesh or Retopologize Higher poly models


## General Mesh Manipulation
### Combining Vertices
- **Method 1.**
  - Click vertices
  - `Press M` to merge
  - Merge at center
- **Method 2.**
  - Go to Tools
  - Options
  - Automerge
  - Turn Snap on > Set to Vertex
  - Press `GG` to slide vertex to the other vertices

### Extrude Along Normals
- `Alt + E`
- Extrude Along Normals

### Joining Objects
- Shift Click 2 objects (The order is important, last object is the destination object)
- `Press E`

### Seperating Objects
- Select Faces
- `Press P` > Seperate by selection

### Select Similiar
- Select an edge
- `Shift + G`
- Crease, Seam, Sharpness

### Fix Circle Merged at Center
- Select the weird faces
- Dissolve Edges
- Poke Face

### Apply All modifiers
- Select All (`Press A`)
- `Space` or `F3`
- Search "Convert to Mesh"
  - Or Menu > Object > Convert to > Mesh


## Hard-Surface Modelling
### Sharpening Edges
- **Mark Crease =**
  - `Shift + E`
  - Controls how strong an edge is affected by Subdivision Modifier
- **Mark Sharp =**
  - Can also use *Edge Split Modifier*
  - Used to define where smooth shading stops

### Smooth Shading
- Click the object
- Go to Object Data > Normals
  - Or right click your object, and Shade Smooth (Turns on the same setting)

### Average Normals (Weird shading)
- Select everything (Press A)
- Mesh > Normals > Average > Face Area
  - Or `Shift + N`

### Working from Low Poly (Non-destructive)
1. Make a low poly model
2. Subdivision Surface Modifier > Viewport: 2
3. Turn on *Uncage*
4. Select Edges and *Mark Crease*
5. Shade Smooth (This will look weird)
6. Two ways to fix this
   1. Select the same edges and *Mark Sharp*
   2. Use the *Edge Split Modifier*


## Sculpting
### Shrinkwrap Low Poly to High Poly
- Object Data
  - Normals > Turn Off Auto Smooth
  - Remesh > Smooth Normals
- Shrinkwrap Modifier
  - Wrap Method: Project
  - Axis: Positive & Negative
  - Target: High poly model
  - Turn on *Uncage*
- Multi-Res Modifier
  - Put it above the Shrinkwrap
  - Subdivide 3 times
- Apply the Shrinkwrap modifier

### Sharpening Edges
- **Mesh Filter Tool**
  - Go to Sculpt Mode
  - Pick the Mesh Filter Tool
  - Drag the cursor from Left to right until you get the desired sharpness
  - This tool also has *Delay Viewport updates*, to reduce the amount of times Blender re-renders the high-poly mesh when moving around the viewport

### Retopology
- **Method 1.** *Multi-res Modifier*
  - Rebuild Subdivisions
- **Method 2.** *Voxel Remesh*
  - Go to Sculpting Mode
  - Remesh Menu
  - Select the resolution
  - Remesh
- **Method 3.** *Instant Meshes*
  - https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes


### Brush Setting
- Brush > Accumulate: So the brushes would add to the previous stroke continuously
- Falloff: Change the shape and roundness of brush
- Smooth Stroke
- 

## Hair Modelling
### Skin Modifier
- Preferences > Enable Extra Meshes
- Add a single vertices
- Start making a path
- Add *Skin Modifier* (It'll look like a rectangle)
- Add *Subdivision Modifier* (This makes the shape rounder)
- Press `Ctrl + A` to adjust the thickness

### Bezier Curve
- Create a *Bezier curve*, and shape it to a triangle (Sharp on the top, smooth on the side/bottom, this is the shape of the hair)
- Create a *Nurbs Path* (Or just a simple path, Curves are harder to control)
- Copy the shape of the Bezier curve to the Nurbs Path
  - Click the path mesh object, switch to *Edit mode*
  - Under the *Object Data Properties*, find the Geometry drop down
  - Under Geometry, click on Bevel
  - Switch to Object
  - Change the object to the Bezier Curve you've created
  - Enable *Fill Caps* so the model isn't hollow/tubular
- Press `Ctrl + T ` to *Twist* the hair
- Press `Alt + S` to make the hair thicker or smaller


## Z-Brush Brushes in Blender
- [Armored Colony - hPolish and Planar sculpting brushes in Blender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIujBF74FQg)

### hPolish Brush
- Use Scrape Brush
- Duplicate the default preset
- **Plane trim** = 0.2 m (Controls how deep from the point gets affected)
- **Normal Radius** = 0.06 (Controls how far the brush radius average the normals)

### Planar
- Use Scrape Brush
- Duplicate the default preset
- Under *Advanced*, turn ON **Use Original** Normal and Plane 
- **Plane Offset** = 0.1 m
- Optional:
  - **Hardness** = 0.9
  - Under Stroke, **Spacing** = 4%
  - Turn on Adust Strength for Spacing

## Default Blender Brushes explained (40+ brushes)
- Note: Some brushes are a combination of two/more brushes

### Draw Brush
- **Draw** = Most basic brush, round shape
  - **Draw Sharp** = Sharper falloff
  - **Clay Strips** = Square shape
- **Clay Thumb** = Pushes mesh like a thumb

### Layer Brush
- **Layer** = Draw with a consistent height, Persistent option caps how far it can pull the mesh

### Smooth Brush
- **Smooth** = Smooths jagged meshes
  - *Deformation* Laplacian smooths the surface and volume, and Surface smooths while perserving volume

### Fill Brush
- **Fill** = Fills gaps between two different heights to the average height
- **Scrape** = Like Fill, but moves vertices above it into the average height
  - *Invert to Fill* setting lets you switch between the Fill and Scrape brush using the `Ctrl` key

### Pinch Brush
- **Pinch** = Moves vertices closer to the center of the brush
- **Rotate**
- **Slide Relax** - Moves geometry to areas to sculpt that requires more detail, Holding `Shift` relaxes to sculpt

### Grab Brush
- **Grab** = Moves the mesh towards the cursor
  - *Grab Silhouette* constricts the movement to the edge of the visible mesh
- **Elastic Deform** = Like Grab, but for bigger movement
- **Snake Hook** - Grabs the mesh and pulls it, but also rotation is included
  - *Magnify* controls how much volume is lost each stroke
  - *Rake* controls how much rotation is lost each stroke
  - *Deformation* Elastic and Deform
- **Thumb** = Like *Clay Thumb* but sticks to the surface, without adding volume
- **Pose Brush** = Moves geometry based on the bones of the object's *Armature*
  - *Deformation* includes Rotate/Twist, Scale/Translate, Squash/Stretch
  - *Rotation Origins* rotates from:
    - Topology (which is automatic based of the volume of the sculpt)
    - Face Sets, which detirmines one bone per *Face sets*
    - Face Sets FK, which applies *Forward Kinematics*
  - *Lock Rotation When Scaling* locks the Axis of the bone when deforming
- **Boundary** = Detects unconnected edges, and deforms them. Relies on good topology to get good results
  - *Deformations* include:
    - Bend
    - Expand
    - Inflate
    - Grab
    - Twist
    - Smooth
  - *Boundary Fallof* detirmines how the Falloff is applied to the edge:
    - Constant = The entire edge
    - Brush Radius = The radius of the brush
    - Loop = Loops the radius of the brush on the entire edge
    - Loop and Invert = Inverted Loop

### Cloth Brush


### Combination Brushes
- **Flatten** = Combines the *Fill* and *Scrape* into one brush
- **Clay** = Combines the *Flatten* and *Draw* brushes
- **Multi-plane Scrape** = Uses 2 planes to scrape a surface
- **Crease** = Combines Punch and Draw sharp brush
